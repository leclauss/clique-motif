# Maximum Clique algorithms

## LMC

"A very efficient exact (BnB) solver for the maximum clique problem in large graphs. It combines efficient preprocessing to eliminate vertices that cannot belong to a maximum clique and incremental MaxSAT reasoning to prune branches that cannot lead to a maximum clique."
